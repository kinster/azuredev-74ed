### Summary

#### Assumptions:
1. **Scale and Measurement**: The scale of the floor plan is 1:125. Linear lengths were estimated by counting occurrences of wall types and measuring their approximate lengths using the scale provided.
2. **Unit Rates**: Rates (Â£/m) were estimated based on typical UK construction costs for similar wall types. These rates may vary depending on project-specific factors.
3. **Wall Type Identification**: Only wall types explicitly marked on the main floor plan image were included in the BoQ. Wall types mentioned in supplementary documents but not found on the main floor plan were excluded.

#### Use of Supplementary Files/Images:
- Supplementary documents were used **only** to clarify the technical descriptions and specifications of wall types (e.g., material composition, acoustic/fire properties).
- No supplementary documents were used for wall counting or measurement.

#### Unmatched Wall Types:
- All wall types identified on the main floor plan were successfully matched to descriptions in the supplementary documents. No unmatched wall types were found.
