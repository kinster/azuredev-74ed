### Summary

#### Assumptions:
1. **Scale and Measurement**: The scale of 1:125 was used to measure wall lengths directly from the main floor plan image. Wall counts were determined by identifying labeled wall types on the plan.
2. **Rates**: Unit rates (Â£/m) were estimated based on typical UK construction costs for similar wall types and specifications.
3. **Wall Types**: Only wall types identified and counted in the main floor plan image (DW, SW, WL) were included in the BoQ. No additional wall types from supplementary documents were added.

#### Use of Supplementary Files/Images:
- **Technical Descriptions**: Supplementary documents were used solely to clarify the construction specifications, fire ratings, acoustic ratings, and thicknesses of each wall type.
- **No Counting or Measurement**: Wall counts and lengths were derived exclusively from the main floor plan image. Supplementary documents were not used for this purpose.

#### Unmatched Wall Types:
- All wall types identified in the main floor plan were successfully matched to their descriptions in the supplementary documents. No unmatched wall types were found.
