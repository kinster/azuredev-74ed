## 1. Identification, Counting, and Measurement of Wall Types

**Methodology:**  
- **Wall types** were identified by visually scanning the main floor plan (first image) for all unique wall tags (e.g., SW.401, WL.401, DW.451, etc.).
- **Count** was determined by tallying each distinct wall segment with a label.
- **Total length** was estimated by visually measuring each wall segment using the planâ€™s scale (1:125 @ A1). For this summary, lengths are estimated based on the number of segments and typical room sizes, as precise measurement tools are not available in this interface.
- **Descriptions** were matched using the supplementary detail sheets, **not** for counting or measurement.

## 3. Summary and Assumptions

### Assumptions
- **Counts and lengths** are based solely on visual inspection of the main floor plan (first image), using the 1:125 scale and wall tags. No digital measurement tools were used; lengths are estimated by segment count and typical room dimensions.
- **Sample rates** are based on typical UK market rates for similar wall types as of 2024. Actual rates may vary by contractor, location, and specification.
- **Variant wall types** (VL.401, NL.401, NL.402, NI.404) are assumed to be minor variants of main wall linings, as their details are not fully clear from the plan or supplementary sheets.
- **Grouped miscellaneous wall linings** for minor/variant types due to low frequency and lack of detailed specification.

### Wall Types Not Fully Matched
- **VL.401, NL.401, NL.402, NI.404:** These appear as variants or special cases on the plan, but their full technical details are not explicit in the supplementary sheets. They are assumed to be similar to standard wall linings for the purposes of this estimate.

### Use of Supplementary Files/Images
- **Supplementary detail sheets** were used **only** to match each wall type code (e.g., DW.451, WL.401, SW.401) to its technical description, construction build-up, fire/acoustic rating, and
