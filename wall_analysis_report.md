## Step 1: Identify Wall Types, Count, and Estimate Lengths (from Main Floor Plan)

**Methodology:**  
- Used only the main floor plan image (Image 1).
- Wall types identified by their tags and colour coding.
- Counted each unique wall type tag.
- Estimated total linear length for each wall type using the scale bar (1:125 @ A1) and by comparing wall runs to the grid (approximate, as per standard takeoff practice from PDF/A1).
- Supplementary documents used only for descriptions.

## Summary of Assumptions

- **Counts and lengths** are based solely on visible tags and wall runs on the main floor plan, measured using the 1:125 scale and grid for reference. Where wall tags repeat on a continuous run, only one count is taken per run.
- **Lengths** are estimated by scaling wall runs against the grid and scale bar; actual site measurement may vary.
- **Descriptions** are matched from supplementary detail sheets (Images 2â€“5) and summarised for clarity.
- **Rates** are sample market rates for 2024, rounded for BoQ purposes. Actual rates should be confirmed by tender or QS.
- **Units** are linear metres unless otherwise specified by the wall type (none were area-based in this set).
- All wall types found on the plan were matched to a technical description; none remain unmatched.
- No allowance made for openings, doors, or deductionsâ€”gross wall lengths only.
- No additional items (e.g., pattressing, fire stopping, acoustic sealant) are included in the BoQ; these should be measured separately if required.
