### Summary

#### Assumptions:
1. **Scale and Measurement**: The scale of the main floor plan (1:125) was used to measure wall lengths. Wall counts were determined by identifying tags on the plan.
2. **Rates**: Unit rates (Â£/m) were estimated based on typical UK construction costs for similar wall types and specifications.
3. **Wall Types**: Only wall types identified and counted in the main floor plan (DW.451, DW.452, DW.453, SW.401, WL.401, WL.404) were included in the BoQ. No additional wall types from supplementary documents were added.

#### Use of Supplementary Files:
- **Technical Descriptions**: Supplementary documents were used to match wall types to their technical descriptions, specifications, fire ratings, acoustic ratings, and thicknesses.
- **Clarifications**: Details such as stud spacing, board types, and fire/acoustic performance were referenced from the supplementary files to ensure accurate descriptions in the BoQ.

#### Exclusions:
- Wall types present only in supplementary documents but not found in the main floor plan were excluded from the BoQ (e.g., WL.402, WL.403, WL.405, etc.).
- No measurements or counts were derived from supplementary documents.
