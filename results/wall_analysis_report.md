### 3. **Estimate Total Length Using Scale (1:125)**

**Method:**  
- The plan is at 1:125 scale.
- Using the grid and wall runs, estimate average wall segment as ~5‚Äì10m, with longer perimeter walls up to 30m.
- For each type, multiply count by an average segment length (short walls ~5m, medium ~8m, long ~12m, perimeter ~20‚Äì30m).

**Estimated Lengths:**

| Wall Type | Count | Est. Avg Length (m) | Total Length (m) |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| SW.401    | 18    | 8                   | ~144             |

### **Assumptions**

- Counts are approximate, based on visible wall tags and OCR; actual counts may vary slightly.
- Lengths are estimated using average wall segment lengths and the 1:125 scale.
- Descriptions are based on the plan legend, standard drylining/blockwork terminology, and naming conventions.
- If technical detail sheets are provided, these should be cross-checked for precise build-ups and fire/acoustic ratings.

If you provide the technical detail sheets, I can refine the descriptions further. Let me know if you need a breakdown for a specific floor or area!

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails1of3-1348828089063799268_markedup_page1.png

Based on the OCR text and the technical detail sheet image provided, here is the structured summary of internal wall types:

---

### 1. **Unique Wall Types Identified**
From both the OCR and the technical detail sheet, the following wall types are listed:
- DW.451
- DW.452
- DW.453
- DW.454
- SH.451
- SH.452
- SH.453

---

### 2. **Count of Each Wall Type**
The OCR text does not provide explicit counts, and the floor plan image is not included here for direct measurement. Normally, you would count each wall type label on the plan.  
**Assumption:** Since the counts are not specified, I will leave this column as "TBC" (To Be Counted from plan image).

---

### 3. **Estimated Total Length (m)**
Without the actual plan image and wall traces, I cannot measure lengths.  
**Assumption:** This column will be marked as "TBC" (To Be Calculated from plan image using 1:125 scale).

---

### 4. **Descriptions (from Technical Sheet)**
Descriptions are summarized from the technical detail sheet you provided.

---

## Structured Table

## **Summary of Assumptions**
- **Counts and lengths** must be determined by reviewing the actual floor plan image and measuring wall segments using the 1:125 scale.
- **Descriptions** are taken directly from the technical detail sheet provided.
- If you provide the floor plan image, I can count and measure each wall type for a complete table.

---

**If you upload the floor plan image, I can complete the count and length columns.**

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails1of3-1348828089063799268_markedup_page1.png_compressed.png

Based on the OCR text and the provided technical detail sheet image, here is the structured analysis of internal wall types:

---

### 1. Unique Wall Types Identified

From both the OCR and the technical detail sheet, the following unique wall types are present:

- DW.451
- DW.452
- DW.453
- DW.454
- SH.451
- SH.452
- SH.453

---

### 2. Count of Each Wall Type

The OCR text lists each wall type once, but this is likely from a legend or key, not from the actual plan layout. Without the floor plan image showing the full layout and wall runs, **I cannot provide an exact count** for each wall type. If you provide the marked-up plan, I can count each instance.

**Assumption:** For now, I will list the count as "TBC" (To Be Counted) until the plan image is provided or clarified.

---

### 3. Total Length Estimation

**Assumption:** As the floor plan image is not provided here, I cannot measure wall lengths. If you upload the plan, I can estimate lengths using the 1:125 scale.

---

### 4. Cross-Reference with Technical Details

Descriptions are taken directly from the technical detail sheet (see image).

---

## Assumptions & Notes

- **Counts and lengths** are placeholders ("TBC") until the actual floor plan image is provided for measurement and counting.
- **Descriptions** are taken verbatim from the technical detail sheet.
- If you provide the floor plan image, I can update the table with accurate counts and length estimates using the 1:125 scale.
- Wall type naming follows standard British Gypsum and drylining conventions (DW = Drywall, SH = Shaftwall).

---

**Please upload or reference the floor plan image with wall type markings for a full quantitative take-off.**

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails2of3-1348828089063799265_markedup_page1.png

Based on the OCR text and the provided detail sheet image, here is the structured analysis of internal wall types:

---

### 1. Unique Wall Types Identified

From both the OCR and the technical detail sheet, the following wall types are listed:

- WL.401
- WL.402
- WL.403
- WL.404
- WL.405
- WL.406
- WL.407

---

### 2. Count of Each Wall Type

From the OCR text, the wall types are mentioned as follows:

- **WL.401**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.
- **WL.402**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.
- **WL.403**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.
- **WL.404**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.
- **WL.405**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.
- **WL.406**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.
- **WL.407**: 1 mention in the technical list, but likely appears multiple times on the plan.

**Note:** The OCR text does not provide explicit counts from the plan image itself. To provide accurate counts and lengths, I would need to visually inspect the floor plan image for each wall type label and measure their extents using the 1:125 scale. Since the plan image is not included in this prompt, I will proceed with a placeholder for counts and lengths, to be filled in after reviewing the plan image.

---

### 3. Technical Descriptions (from Detail Sheet)

Below are the wall types with their technical descriptions, as extracted from the detail sheet:

| Wall Type | Description |

### 5. Assumptions

- **Counts and lengths**: Cannot be determined from OCR text alone; require visual inspection of the floor plan image.
- **Descriptions**: Taken directly from the technical detail sheet.
- **No other wall types**: Only the above wall types are referenced in the OCR and detail sheet.
- **Scale**: The drawing scale is 1:125. Lengths should be measured on the plan image and converted accordingly.

---

**Next Step:**  
Please provide the floor plan image so I can count the instances of each wall type and estimate their total lengths using the scale. Once the image is available, I will update the table with accurate counts and lengths.

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails3of3-1348828089063799267_markedup_page1.png

### Step 1: Identify All Unique Wall Types

From the OCR text and the technical detail sheet image, the following wall types are identified:

- SW.401
- SW.402
- WL.408
- WL.409

### Step 2: Count Occurrences

From the OCR text, each wall type is mentioned once. If the floor plan image (not provided here) shows more instances, those should be counted visually. Based on the provided text and detail sheet, the count is:

- SW.401: 1
- SW.402: 1
- WL.408: 1
- WL.409: 1

**Note:** If you have the floor plan image and can count more instances, update these numbers accordingly.

### Step 3: Estimate Total Length (using scale 1:125)

**Assumption:**  
Since the actual floor plan image is not provided for measurement, I will assume each wall type represents a single wall of approximately 5 meters in length (a typical room or partition wall length for estimation purposes). If you have the floor plan, use a scale ruler or digital measurement tool to get the actual lengths.

### Step 4: Match Wall Types to Descriptions

Using the technical detail sheet (bottom of the image), here are the descriptions:

#### SW.401
- **Description:** Medium density paint quality blockwork, 140mm thick, compressive strength >50N/nm¬≤, fire rating 240min, acoustic rating Rw 59dB, for compartment and compliant junctions.

#### SW.402
- **Description:** 215mm thick fully bonded brickwork wall, frogged flettons, English bond, fair faced, fire rating 240min, acoustic rating Rw 64dB, for UKPN standard, compartmentation.

#### WL.408
- **Description:** GypLyner IWL independent wall lining, 97mm thick, fire rating 120min, acoustic rating Rw 45dB, for internal lining to East Party Wall.

#### WL.409
- **Description:** Gypsum DriLyner Dab lining system, 25mm thick, fire rating 120min, acoustic rating Rw 45dB, for internal lining to Firefighting Lobby.

### Assumptions & Notes

- **Counts** are based on the OCR text and technical detail sheet; actual counts may be higher if more instances are shown on the floor plan.
- **Total Lengths** are estimated at 5m each as a placeholder; use the scale (1:125) and the floor plan to measure actual lengths for accurate results.
- **Descriptions** are directly from the technical detail sheet at the bottom of the provided image.
- If you provide the actual floor plan image or counts/lengths, the table can be updated with precise data.

Let me know if you want to update the counts or lengths based on the actual floor plan!
