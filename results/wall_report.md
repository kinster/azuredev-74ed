### 2. Summary of Key Assumptions, Uncertainties, and Dominant Systems

#### **Key Assumptions**
- **Scale:** All measurements are based on the 1:125 scale as noted on the drawings.
- **Wall Heights:** Where not explicitly stated, a standard height of 2.7m is assumed for all partitions.
- **Material Quantities:** Calculated using standard drylining system build-ups (e.g., board both sides, studs at 600mm centers).
- **Labour Productivity:** Assumed average rates (e.g., 4m²/hr for partitions, 5m²/hr for ceilings, 0.2hr/opening).
- **Waste Factor:** 10% added to all material quantities for cutting and site waste (included in totals above).
- **Openings:** Counted visually; actual sizes and lintel requirements to be confirmed.

#### **Uncertainties**
- **Ceiling Types:** Only MF (metal frame) ceilings are annotated; any additional ceiling types or soffit details are not visible.
- **Wall Heights:** Some areas may have bulkheads or varying heights not visible in plan.
- **Wall Types:** Some tags partially obscured or ambiguous; only clearly legible tags included.
- **Openings:** Some small hatches or service penetrations may not be visible at this scale.
- **Material Build-ups:** Specification descriptions are inferred from standard practice and visible tags; refer to full technical detail sheets for confirmation.

#### **Dominant System Types**
- **Solid Walls (SW.401, SW.402):** Most prevalent, forming the main partition layout.
- **Demountable Walls (DW.401, DW.402):** Used extensively in internal subdivisions.
- **Acoustic Walls (SW.451, DW.451):** Used in select areas, likely for meeting rooms or plant rooms.
- **MF Ceilings:** Covering most of the floor plate in both ground and first floor plans.

#### **Visual Confirmation**
All quantities and types are based solely on visible tags, line types, and annotations in the provided drawings. Where information is missing or unclear, this is noted in the summary above.

### 2. Summary of Assumptions & Observations

- **Drawing Content:** The provided image is a technical detail sheet (not a floor plan), showing wall build-ups WL.401 to WL.407 with annotated descriptions and typical construction details.
- **Wall Types:** Seven distinct wall types are identified (WL.401–WL.407), each with a unique specification and colour code.
- **Measurement:** No floor plan or scale is visible, so actual wall lengths, heights, or ceiling areas cannot be measured. Each wall type is counted once as a sample detail.
- **Openings:** No window, door, or hatch openings are visible in this detail sheet.
- **Descriptions:** Each wall type’s description is transcribed from the drawing, including board thickness, stud size, insulation, and special notes (e.g., fire or acoustic performance).
- **Materials:** Materials are inferred from the wall build-up notes (studs, board layers, insulation, fixings).
- **Labour:** Labour hours are estimated per linear metre based on standard drylining productivity rates (e.g., 0.5–0.8 hrs/m depending on complexity).
- **Ceilings:** No ceiling types or areas are shown in this image.
- **Uncertainties:** 
    - No scale or plan view is provided, so no actual quantities can be calculated.
    - No opening counts or ceiling areas are available.
    - This report is limited to technical wall build-up details only.

#### **Dominant System Types**
- Metal stud partitions with varying board thicknesses and insulation levels.
- Acoustic and fire-rated systems are present.
- No MF ceilings or lay-in grid ceilings are shown.

**If a floor plan is provided, a full take-off with measured quantities and opening counts can be completed.**

### 2. Summary of Key Assumptions and Observations

- **Wall Types Detected:**  
  - **SW 401**: Masonry blockwork (not a drylining system, included for reference).
  - **SW 402**: Thicker masonry blockwork (not a drylining system, included for reference).
  - **WL 408**: Lightweight metal stud partition with acoustic insulation and double plasterboard.
  - **WL 409**: Enhanced acoustic metal stud partition with thicker boards and studs.

- **Ceilings:**  
  - No ceiling types or areas are visible on this detail sheet.

- **Openings:**  
  - No windows, doors, or hatches are shown in these wall section details.

- **Measurements:**  
  - This sheet provides only wall section details, not plan views. No total lengths, heights, or areas can be measured from this sheet alone.
  - Heights are indicated (e.g., floor-to-ceiling), but without plan context, total quantities cannot be established.

- **Descriptions:**  
  - All wall types are matched to their specification as per the detail sheet.
  - Materials are listed as per manufacturer/system standard.

- **Material Quantities & Labour:**  
  - Standard productivity rates assumed:  
    - Metal stud partitions: **0.6–0.7 hr/m²** (industry norm for standard and acoustic partitions).
  - Waste factor not applied due to lack of measurable quantities.

- **Uncertainties:**  
  - **No plan view provided:** Cannot count or measure actual wall runs or ceiling areas.
  - **No openings shown:** No deductions for doors/windows.
  - **Scale not visible:** Cannot confirm measurements.
  - **Dominant system types:** GypWall QUIET systems (WL 408, WL 409) are the primary drylining partitions detailed.

---

#### **Next Steps / Recommendations**
- Obtain the architectural floor plan with wall tags and a visible scale to measure actual quantities.
- Cross-reference these detail types with the plan to count and measure each wall run.
- Apply productivity and waste factors to measured quantities for a full cost estimate.

This report is based solely on the visible detail sheet provided. Quantities and costings are indicative only and must be verified against scaled plan drawings for a complete BoQ.
