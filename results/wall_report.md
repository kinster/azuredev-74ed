### Step 1: Identify and List All Unique Wall Types

From the OCR and the plan legend, the following unique wall types are identified (with their colour codes for cross-reference):

- SW.401
- WL.401
- WL.402
- WL.404
- WL.405
- WL.406
- WL.407
- WL.408
- WL.409
- DW.451
- DW.452
- DW.453
- DW.454
- SH.451
- SH.452
- SH.453
- CC.401

### Step 2: Count Occurrences and Estimate Linear Lengths

#### Methodology
- **Count**: Each wall type is counted based on the number of labelled segments on both Ground and Level 01 plans.
- **Length**: Using the scale (1:125), measure the length of each wall segment. For this summary, lengths are estimated based on typical room sizes and the number of segments, as precise digital measurement is not possible here.

#### Table of Wall Types

## Summary of Assumptions

- **Rates**: Unit rates (£/m) are estimated based on typical UK drylining and partition costs (2024) and adjusted for fire/acoustic performance and wall thickness. Actual rates may vary by location, specification, and market conditions.
- **Measurement Accuracy**: Wall counts and lengths are estimated for demonstration. Actual quantities should be measured from the scaled floor plan using the 1:125 scale.
- **Description Match Confidence**: Wall types are matched directly from the provided technical detail sheet. Confidence is high as the codes and descriptions align clearly.
- **Units**: All quantities are in linear metres, as per UK BoQ convention for partitions.
- **Exclusions**: No allowance for doors, glazing, or special interfaces; only straight wall runs are included.
- **Unmatched Types**: All wall types listed in the OCR and detail sheet have been matched; none are unmatched.

**If you provide the actual floor plan image and tag counts, I can refine the quantities and costs further.**

## 🖼️ CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails1of3-1348828089063799268_markedup_page1.png_compressed.png

Let's break down the required outputs step by step, using the OCR text and the provided wall type detail sheet image.

---

## 1. Identify and List All Unique Wall Types

From the OCR and the detail sheet, the following unique wall types are present:

- DW.451
- DW.452
- DW.453
- DW.454
- SH.451
- SH.452
- SH.453

---

## 2. Count How Many Times Each Appears

**Note:** The OCR text does not provide explicit counts or a floor plan image to measure. In a real scenario, you would count each wall type tag on the plan. For this exercise, let's assume the following sample counts (to be replaced with actuals from the plan):

| Wall Type | Sample Count |
|-----------|--------------|
| DW.451    | 12           |
| DW.452    | 8            |
| DW.453    | 6            |
| DW.454    | 4            |
| SH.451    | 3            |
| SH.452    | 2            |
| SH.453    | 1            |

---

## 3. Estimate the Total Linear Length for Each (using scale 1:125)

**Assumption:**  
- Average wall segment per tag = 3.5m (typical for UK office/commercial layouts; adjust as per actual measurement from plan).
- Total Length = Count × Average Segment Length

| Wall Type | Count | Total Length (m) |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| DW.451    | 12    | 42.0             |
| DW.452    | 8     | 28.0             |
| DW.453    | 6     | 21.0             |
| DW.454    | 4     | 14.0             |
| SH.451    | 3     | 10.5             |
| SH.452    | 2     | 7.0              |
| SH.453    | 1     | 3.5              |

## **Summary of Assumptions**

- **Rates**: Sample rates are estimated based on typical UK market values for commercial drylining and shaftwall systems. Actual rates may vary by location, specification, and procurement.
- **Measurement Accuracy**: Wall counts and lengths are estimated based on assumed average wall segment length (3.5m per tag). Actual measurements should be taken from the scaled floor plan.
- **Description Match Confidence**: Wall type-to-description matching is high confidence, as the detail sheet directly lists each wall type and its specification.
- **Unmatched Wall Types**: All wall types from the OCR and detail sheet have been matched. If additional types are found on the plan, they should be added accordingly.

---

**If you provide the actual floor plan image with visible wall tags, I can refine counts and lengths for greater accuracy.**

## Summary of Assumptions

- **Rates:** Unit rates are estimated based on typical UK drylining and partitioning rates (2024). Actual rates may vary by location, specification, and contractor pricing.
- **Measurement Accuracy:** Counts and lengths are illustrative. Actual quantities should be measured from the scaled floor plan using the 1:125 scale.
- **Description Match Confidence:** Wall types are matched with high confidence to the technical descriptions provided on the detail sheet. If any wall types are present on the plan but not on the detail sheet, they should be flagged for clarification.
- **Units:** All quantities are in linear metres, as per standard UK BoQ practice for wall linings/partitions unless area-based measurement is specified.
- **Scope:** Only internal wall linings/partitions are included; no external walls or other elements.

**If you provide the actual floor plan image, I can count and measure the wall types precisely.**

## 🖼️ CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails3of3-1348828089063799267_markedup_page1.png

### Step 1: Identify and List Unique Wall Types

From the OCR and the detail sheet image, the following wall types are identified:
- SW.401
- SW.402
- WL.408
- WL.409

### Step 2: Count Occurrences

The OCR text does not provide a count of each wall type’s occurrence. Normally, this would be done by visually inspecting the floor plan and counting each wall type label. Since only the detail sheet is provided (not the full floor plan), I will **assume** each wall type appears **twice** as a placeholder for demonstration. Please update with actual counts if available.

### Step 3: Estimate Total Linear Length

Without the actual floor plan, I will **assume** each wall type runs for approximately **10m per occurrence** (typical for internal partitions in a commercial building). This is a placeholder—please update with actual measurements if available.

### Step 4: Match Wall Types to Descriptions

From the detail sheet, the descriptions are as follows:

#### SW.401 (Medium density paint quality blockwork)
- 140mm thick
- Medium density paint quality blockwork
- Fire rating: 120min
- Acoustic rating: Rw 45dB
- For use where fire and acoustic performance required

#### SW.402 (215mm thick, fully bonded brickwork wall)
- 215mm thick, fully bonded brickwork wall, frogged flettons, English bond
- Fire rating: 240min
- Acoustic rating: Rw 59dB
- For use where high fire and acoustic performance required

#### WL.408 (GypLyner IWL Independent wall lining)
- 97mm thick
- GypLyner IWL Independent wall lining
- Fire rating: N/A
- Acoustic rating: Rw 45dB
- For internal lining to East Party Wall

#### WL.409 (Gypsum DriLyner Dab lining system)
- 25mm thick
- Gypsum DriLyner Dab lining system
- Fire rating: 120min
- Acoustic rating: Rw 45dB
- For internal lining to Firefighting Lobby

## Summary of Assumptions

- **Rates**: Sample rates are based on typical UK commercial fit-out rates (2024) and include supply and install. Actual rates may vary by location, specification, and market conditions.
- **Measurement**: Counts and lengths are placeholders (2 occurrences per wall type, 10m each). Actual quantities should be measured from the floor plan using the 1:125 scale.
- **Description Match**: Wall types and descriptions are matched with high confidence from the detail sheet provided.
- **Units**: All quantities are in linear metres, as is standard for wall partitions unless otherwise specified.
- **Exclusions**: No allowance for doors, windows, or special finishes. No area-based linings included.

**Note:** Please update the count and length columns with actual measurements from the floor plan for a precise BoQ. If you provide the floor plan image, I can extract and measure the wall types accurately.
