## 1. **List All Unique Wall Types**

From the OCR and the plan legend, the following wall types are identified:

- WL.401
- WL.402
- WL.404
- WL.405
- WL.406
- WL.407
- WL.408
- WL.409
- SW.401
- SW.452
- DW.451
- DW.452
- DW.453
- DW.454
- SH.451
- SH.452
- SH.453
- CC.401

---

## 2. **Count Each Wall Type**

Counts are estimated by visually scanning the plan and cross-referencing with the OCR text. For accuracy, the colored outlines on the plan are used (each wall type is color-coded in the legend).

| Wall Type | Color (from legend) | Approx. Count (per both floors) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| WL.401    | Yellow              | 18                              |

| SH.451    | Black               | 13                              |
| SH.452    | Light Green         | 7                               |
| SH.453    | Light Purple        | 2                               |
| CC.401    | Light Brown         | 2                               |

## 3. **Estimate Total Lengths (Scale 1:125)**

**Method:**  
- The plan is at 1:125 scale.  
- A typical room is ~5‚Äì7m across on the plan, so a wall segment is ~2‚Äì10m depending on room size.
- For each count, estimate average wall segment length as 4m (conservative for internal partitions).

| Wall Type | Count | Est. Total Length (m) |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| WL.401    | 18    | ~72                  |
| WL.402    | 4     | ~16                  |
| WL.404    | 14    | ~56                  |
| WL.405    | 3     | ~12                  |
| WL.406    | 8     | ~32                  |
| WL.407    | 3     | ~12                  |
| WL.408    | 2     | ~8                   |
| WL.409    | 2     | ~8                   |
| SW.401    | 22    | ~88                  |
| SW.452    | 3     | ~12                  |
| DW.451    | 7     | ~28                  |
| DW.452    | 12    | ~48                  |
| DW.453    | 14    | ~56                  |
| DW.454    | 1     | ~4                   |
| SH.451    | 13    | ~52                  |
| SH.452    | 7     | ~28                  |
| SH.453    | 2     | ~8                   |

## **Assumptions & Notes**

- **Counts** are estimated from both the OCR and visual scan of the plan. Actual counts may vary slightly.
- **Lengths** are estimated using an average wall segment of 4m. For more precision, use a digital scale tool on the plan.
- **Descriptions** are matched from the plan legend and typical UK drylining nomenclature.
- Some wall types (e.g., variants) may have more specific technical details in the full technical detail sheets, which should be referenced for construction.
- If you provide the technical detail sheets, more precise descriptions can be given.

---

**If you have technical detail sheets, please upload them for more accurate descriptions.**

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails1of3-1348828089063799268_markedup_page1.png

Let's break down the task step by step:

### 1. **List all unique wall types**
From the OCR and the technical detail sheet image, the following wall types are present:
- DW.451
- DW.452
- DW.453
- DW.454
- SH.451
- SH.452
- SH.453

### 2. **Count how many times each appears**
The OCR text does not provide explicit counts for each wall type. Typically, this would require reviewing the floor plan image itself and counting the labels. Since the floor plan image is not provided here, I will note that the count is **not available** and should be filled in after reviewing the plan.

### 3. **Estimate total length using the drawing scale (1:125)**
Again, without the actual floor plan image, the total length for each wall type cannot be measured here. This requires tracing each wall type on the scaled drawing. I will mark this as **TBC (To Be Confirmed)**.

### 4. **Cross-reference wall types with technical details**
From the detail sheet, here are the descriptions for each wall type:

---

## **Assumptions & Notes**
- **Counts and lengths**: These must be determined by reviewing the actual floor plan image and measuring using the 1:125 scale. The table above is ready for these values to be filled in.
- **Descriptions**: Taken directly from the technical detail sheet in the provided image.
- **Naming conventions**: "DW" = Drywall, "SH" = Shaftwall, as per British Gypsum and common UK practice.
- **If you provide the floor plan image**, I can count and measure each wall type for you.

---

**Next Steps:**  
- Please provide the floor plan image or a marked-up version, and I can complete the count and length calculations for each wall type.

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails2of3-1348828089063799265_markedup_page1.png

Based on the OCR text and the provided technical detail sheet image, here is the structured analysis of the internal wall types:

---

### 1. **Unique Wall Types Identified**
From both the OCR and the technical detail sheet, the following wall types are listed:
- WL.401
- WL.402
- WL.403
- WL.404
- WL.405
- WL.406
- WL.407

---

### 2. **Count of Each Wall Type**
From the OCR text, the explicit mentions are:
- WL.401: 1
- WL.402: 1
- WL.403: 1
- WL.404: 1
- WL.405: 1
- WL.406: 1
- WL.407: 1

However, these counts are from the technical detail sheet, not the floor plan itself. The actual floor plan image (not shown here) would typically have these wall types marked throughout the plan, and the counts would be based on the number of wall segments labeled with each type.  
**Assumption:** Since only the technical sheet is provided, and not the annotated floor plan, I will use the counts as "1" for each type as placeholders. Please update with actual counts from the plan image if available.

---

### 3. **Estimated Total Length**
**Assumption:** Without the floor plan image and wall measurements, I cannot estimate the total length for each wall type.  
**Placeholder:** Marked as "TBC" (To Be Confirmed).

---

### 4. **Descriptions from Technical Detail Sheet**
Descriptions are summarized from the technical detail sheet image.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Wall Type | Count | Total Length (m) | Description                                                                                          |

---

## **Assumptions**
- Counts are based on the technical detail sheet, not the actual floor plan. Actual counts and lengths should be updated from the annotated plan.
- Total lengths are not estimated due to lack of plan image and scale measurements.
- Descriptions are directly summarized from the technical detail sheet.
- If you provide the annotated floor plan image, I can update counts and estimate lengths using the 1:125 scale.

---

**Please provide the marked-up floor plan image for accurate counts and length estimations.**

## üñºÔ∏è CommercialBuildingInternalWallTypesTypicalDetails3of3-1348828089063799267_markedup_page1.png

Let's break down the requirements step by step:

### 1. **List all unique wall types**
From the OCR and the technical detail sheet, the following wall types are identified:
- SW.401
- SW.402
- WL.408
- WL.409

### 2. **Count how many times each type appears**
From the OCR text, each wall type is mentioned once. However, the actual count of each wall type on the floor plan image itself is not provided in the OCR and cannot be determined from the technical detail sheet alone. If you want a precise count, you would need to mark each instance on the floor plan image. For this answer, I'll use the count from the OCR (which is 1 for each), but **please update with actual counts from the plan if available**.

### 3. **Estimate total length using the drawing scale (1:125)**
The technical detail sheet does not show the floor plan, so no wall lengths can be measured from this image. If you provide the floor plan image, I can estimate lengths using the scale. For now, I'll mark this as "TBC" (to be confirmed).

### 4. **Cross-reference wall types with technical details**
Descriptions are provided in the technical detail sheet at the bottom of the image.

## Structured Table

| Wall Type | Count | Total Length (m) | Description |
|-----------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| SW.401    | 1     | TBC              | Medium density paint quality blockwork, 140mm thick, compressive strength >50N/mm¬≤, fire rating 240min, acoustic rating Rw 59dB, for compartment and compliant junctions. |
| SW.402    | 1     | TBC              | 215mm thick fully bonded brickwork wall, frogged flettons, English bond, fair faced, fire rating 240min, acoustic rating Rw 64dB, for UKPN standard. |
| WL.408    | 1     | TBC              | GypLyner IWL independent wall lining, 70mm "I" studs, 97mm thick, fire rating 120min, acoustic rating Rw 45dB, for internal lining to East Party Wall. |
| WL.409    | 1     | TBC              | Gypsum DriLyner Dab lining system, 25mm thick, fire rating 120min, acoustic rating Rw 45dB, for internal lining to Firefighting Lobby. |

---

## **Summary of Assumptions**
- **Counts**: Only one instance of each wall type is found in the OCR text. Actual counts on the floor plan may differ.
- **Lengths**: Cannot be estimated without the floor plan image. "TBC" used as placeholder.
- **Descriptions**: Taken directly from the technical detail sheet in the provided image.
- **If you provide the floor plan image**, I can update the table with accurate counts and measured lengths using the 1:125 scale.
